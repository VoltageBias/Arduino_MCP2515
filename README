These files are part of a project to interface an Arduino to a MCP2515 CAN module, and transmit data
to a Texas Instruments TM4C Lauchpad.

A detailed project description is at VoltageBias.blogspot.co.uk.

To use with Arduino, copy all files except "Lauchpad_CAN_temp_rx" into a folder named ARDUINO_MCP2515_CANBus_Tx, then launch.

A set of handy functions is included, to simplify communicating with the MCP2515
